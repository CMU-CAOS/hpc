# MLPerfâ„¢ HPC reference implementations

This is a repository of reference implementations for the MLPerf HPC benchmarks.

General format should follow https://github.com/mlperf/training.

## Rules

The MLPerf HPC v0.5 rules are based on the MLPerf Training v0.7 rules with
some adjustments.

The MLPerf Training rules are available at [training\_rules](https://github.com/mlperf-hpc/training_policies/blob/hpc-0.5.0/training_rules.adoc).

The MLPerf HPC specific rules are at [hpc\_training\_rules](https://github.com/mlperf-hpc/training_policies/blob/hpc-0.5.0/hpc_training_rules.adoc).

## Compliance

The MLPerf logging package implements logging and compliance-checking utilities
for MLPerf benchmarks. We have a temporary fork and hpc-0.5.0 branch in which we
are adding support for MLPerf-HPC v0.5 at
https://github.com/mlperf-hpc/logging/tree/hpc-0.5.0

To install and test compliance of your runs/submissions:
```
# Install the package into your python environment.
# A development install (-e) is recommended for now so you can pull new updates.
git clone -b hpc-0.5.0 https://github.com/mlperf-hpc/logging.git mlperf-logging
pip install [--user] -e mlperf-logging

# Test compliance of a specific mlperf hpc log file
python -m mlperf_logging.compliance_checker --ruleset hpc_0.5.0 $logFile

# Test a system description file (we just use the Training v0.7 rules)
python -m mlperf_logging.system_desc_checker $jsonFile training 0.7.0

# Test a full submission folder
python -m mlperf_logging.package_checker $submissionDir hpc 0.5.0
```
